# Natural Language Processing Portfolio

Welcome to my NLP Portfolio, this reposiroty showcases the projects that I have worked on Natural Language Processing Applictions. This include my applied explorations and a project for every part. Check it out! 

## Completed :white_check_mark:

### Part 1: Exploring pre-trained NLP models
- HuggingFace models and libraries
- Text classification
- Translation
- Summarization
- Question answering and chatbots

#### Project: Financial Text Sentiment Analysis App
- For this project I built a Gui APP that allowed to extract the sentiment from finance related texts. 

### Part 2: Classic algorithms

- Working with the NLTK, working with corpora, and text processing
- Markov Model text generation
- Hidden Markov Models
- Lesk Algorithm

#### Project: Text Summarization and Question Answering App
- 

## Working :computer:
### Part 3: Syntax, Parsing, and Linguistic Structures

- Syntax and Grammatical Structures
- Constituency Parsing vs. Dependency Parsing
- Context-Free Grammars (CFG) and Parsing Algorithms (like CYK)
- Role of syntax in NLP (e.g., improving translation models, named entity recognition, etc.)

## Future Work:new:
### Part 4: Neural Networks for NLP

- Building and training neural nets in Keras (maybe TensorFlow or PyTorch too)
- Recurrent neural networks and LSTM

### Part 5: Word Embeddings

- Bag of Words
- TF-IDF
- Word2Vec
- GloVe

### Part 6: Transformers

- Attention and transformer overview
- Popular transformer-based architectures

### Part 7: Fine-Tuning Pretrained Models
