# Natural Language Processing Portfolio :smiley:

Welcome to my NLP Portfolio, this reposiroty showcases the projects that I have worked on Natural Language Processing Applictions. This include my applied explorations and a project for every part. Check it out! 

## Completed :white_check_mark:

### Part 1: Exploring pre-trained NLP models
- HuggingFace models and libraries
- Text classification
- Translation
- Summarization
- Question answering and chatbots

#### [Project: Financial Text Sentiment Analysis App](https://github.com/gonzalovaldenebro/NaturalLanguageProcessing-Portfolio/tree/d43552d1ef5a7f445acb564e24f29f8346847dc7/Part%201%20-%20Exploring%20Pre-Trained%20NLP%20Models/Project)

- For this project I built a Gui APP that allowed to extract the sentiment from finance related texts 

### Part 2: Classic algorithms

- Working with the NLTK, working with corpora, and text processing
- Markov Model text generation
- Hidden Markov Models
- Lesk Algorithm

#### [Project: Text Summarization and Question Answering App](https://github.com/gonzalovaldenebro/NaturalLanguageProcessing-Portfolio/tree/013e582ec0a66792cb37921b22e19a62f37c3360/Part%202%20-%20Classical%20Algorithms/Project)

- For this project I built a Gui APP that allows the user to paste a text, summarize and asnwer questions related to the original text

### Part 3: Syntax, Parsing, and Linguistic Structures

- Syntax and Grammatical Structures
- Constituency Parsing vs. Dependency Parsing
- Context-Free Grammars (CFG) and Parsing Algorithms (like CYK)
- Role of syntax in NLP (e.g., improving translation models, named entity recognition, etc.)

#### [Project: Translation and Tokenization App](https://github.com/gonzalovaldenebro/NaturalLanguageProcessing-Portfolio/tree/main/Part%203%20-%20Syntax%2C%20Parsing%2C%20and%20Linguistic%20Structures/Project)

- This Python application combines text translation and tokenization using the Transformers library and the Tkinter framework. It allows users to input a sentence, choose source and target languages, and get translations with tokenization and part-of-speech tagging.

### Part 4: Lexical Syntax and Semantics

- Constituency Parsing vs. Dependency Parsing
- Word Sense Disambiguation
- Context-Free Grammars

#### [Project: Grammar Checker App](https://github.com/gonzalovaldenebro/NaturalLanguageProcessing-Portfolio/tree/main/Part%204%20-%20Lexical%20Syntax%20and%20Semantics/Project)

- This Python application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for part-of-speech (POS) tagging of text using the BERT-based model from AdapterHub. It allows users to input text and interactively assign POS tags to words, as well as view the model's analysis of the input text. 

### Part 5: Machine Learning for NLP

- Building and training neural nets in Keras (maybe TensorFlow or PyTorch too)
- Recurrent neural networks and LSTM

#### [Project: Text Classification Neural Network App](https://github.com/gonzalovaldenebro/NaturalLanguageProcessing-Portfolio/tree/main/Part%205%20-%20Neural%20Network%20for%20NLP/Project)

### Part 6:  Neural Networks for NLP

- Encoder/ Decoder
- TF-IDF
- Long Term Recurrence

### Part 7: Fine-Tuning Pretrained Models

- Transfer Learning
- Attention Transformers 
- Conversational Models
- RLHF

#### [Project: Fine Tunned Medical Question Answering Model](https://github.com/gonzalovaldenebro/NaturalLanguageProcessing-Portfolio/tree/main/Part%207%20-%20Fine-Tunning%20Pretrained%20Models/Project)
