'\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman', ' I have seldom heard him\\r\\nmention her under any other name', ' In his eyes she eclipses and\\r\\npredominates the whole of her sex', ' It was not that he felt any emotion\\r\\nakin to love for Irene Adler', ' All emotions, and that one particularly,\\r\\nwere abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind', ' He\\r\\nwas, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that\\r\\nthe world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a\\r\\nfalse position', ' He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe\\r\\nand a sneer', ' They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for\\r\\ndrawing the veil from men’s motives and actions', ' But for the trained\\r\\nreasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely\\r\\nadjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might\\r\\nthrow a doubt upon all his mental results', ' Grit in a sensitive\\r\\ninstrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not\\r\\nbe more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his', ' And\\r\\nyet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene\\r\\nAdler, of dubious and questionable memory', '\\r\\n\\r\\nI had seen little of Holmes lately', ' My marriage had drifted us away\\r\\nfrom each other', ' My own complete happiness, and the home-centred\\r\\ninterests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\\r\\nof his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,\\r\\nwhile Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian\\r\\nsoul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old\\r\\nbooks, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,\\r\\nthe drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\\r\\nnature', ' He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,\\r\\nand occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of\\r\\nobservation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\\r\\nmysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police', '\\r\\nFrom time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his\\r\\nsummons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up\\r\\nof the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and\\r\\nfinally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\\r\\nsuccessfully for the reigning family of Holland', ' Beyond these signs of\\r\\nhis activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\\r\\nthe daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion', '\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning from a\\r\\njourney to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when\\r\\nmy way led me through Baker Street', ' As I passed the well-remembered\\r\\ndoor, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\\r\\nwith the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\\r\\nkeen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\\r\\nextraordinary powers', ' His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I\\r\\nlooked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\\r\\nagainst the blind', ' He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\\r\\nhead sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him', ' To me, who\\r\\nknew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\\r\\nstory', ' He was at work again', ' He had risen out of his drug-created\\r\\ndreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem', ' I rang the bell\\r\\nand was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own', '\\r\\n\\r\\nHis manner was not effusive', ' It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\\r\\nto see me', ' With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\\r\\nme to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\\r\\nspirit case and a gasogene in the corner', ' Then he stood before the fire\\r\\nand looked me over in his singular introspective fashion', '\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked', ' “I think, Watson, that you have put\\r\\non seven and a half pounds since I saw you', '”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Seven!” I answered', '\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indeed, I should have thought a little more', ' Just a trifle more, I\\r\\nfancy, Watson', ' And in practice again, I observe', ' You did not tell me\\r\\nthat you intended to go into harness', '”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then, how do you know?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I see it, I deduce it', ' How do I know that you have been getting\\r\\nyourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\\r\\nservant girl?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much', ' You would certainly have\\r\\nbeen burned, had you lived a few centuries ago', ' It is true that I had a\\r\\ncountry walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\\r\\nhave changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it', ' As to Mary\\r\\nJane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,\\r\\nagain, I fail to see how you work it out', '”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together', '\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside\\r\\nof your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is\\r\\nscored by six almost parallel cuts', ' Obviously they have been caused by\\r\\nsomeone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in\\r\\norder to remove crusted mud from it', ' Hence, you see, my double\\r\\ndeduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\\r\\nparticularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey', ' As\\r\\nto your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of\\r\\niodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right\\r\\nforefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where\\r\\nhe has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not\\r\\npronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession', '”\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\\r\\nprocess of deduction', ' “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,\\r\\n“the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I\\r\\ncould easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\\r\\nreasoning I am baffled until you explain your process', ' And yet I\\r\\nbelieve that my eyes are as good as yours', '”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\\r\\ndown into an armchair', ' “You see, but you do not observe', ' The\\r\\ndistinction is clear', ' For example, you have frequently seen the steps\\r\\nwhich lead up from the hall to this room', '”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Frequently', '”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How often?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, some hundreds of times', '”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then how many are there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How many? I don’t know', '”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so! You have not observed', ' And yet you have seen', ' That is just\\r\\nmy point', ' Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\\r\\nboth seen and observed', ' By the way, since you are interested in these\\r\\nlittle problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\\r\\nof my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this', '” He threw\\r\\nover a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open\\r\\nupon the table', ' “It came by the last post,” said he', ' “Read it aloud', '”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address', '\\r\\n\\r\\n“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it\\r\\nsaid, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very\\r\\ndeepest moment', ' Your recent services to one of the royal houses of\\r\\nEurope have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\\r\\nmatters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated', '\\r\\nThis account of you we have from all quarters received', ' Be in your\\r\\nchamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\\r\\nwear a mask', '”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked', ' “What do you imagine that it\\r\\nmeans?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have no data yet', ' It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\\r\\ndata', ' Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\\r\\ntheories to suit facts', ' But the note itself', ' What do you deduce from\\r\\nit?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\\r\\nwritten', '\\r\\n\\r\\n“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,\\r\\nendeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes', ' “Such paper could not\\r\\nbe bought under half a crown a packet', ' It is peculiarly strong and\\r\\nstiff', '”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes', ' “It is not an English\\r\\npaper at all', ' Hold it up to the light']\n"

'\\r\\n\\r\\nto sherlock holmes she is always _the_ woman', ' i have seldom heard him\\r\\nmention her under any other name', ' in his eyes she eclipses and\\r\\npredominates the whole of her sex', ' it was not that he felt any emotion\\r\\nakin to love for irene adler', ' all emotions, and that one particularly,\\r\\nwere abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind', ' he\\r\\nwas, i take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that\\r\\nthe world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a\\r\\nfalse position', ' he never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe\\r\\nand a sneer', ' they were admirable things for the observer—excellent for\\r\\ndrawing the veil from men’s motives and actions', ' but for the trained\\r\\nreasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely\\r\\nadjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might\\r\\nthrow a doubt upon all his mental results', ' grit in a sensitive\\r\\ninstrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not\\r\\nbe more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his', ' and\\r\\nyet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late irene\\r\\nadler, of dubious and questionable memory', '\\r\\n\\r\\ni had seen little of holmes lately', ' my marriage had drifted us away\\r\\nfrom each other', ' my own complete happiness, and the home-centred\\r\\ninterests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\\r\\nof his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,\\r\\nwhile holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian\\r\\nsoul, remained in our lodgings in baker street, buried among his old\\r\\nbooks, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,\\r\\nthe drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\\r\\nnature', ' he was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,\\r\\nand occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of\\r\\nobservation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\\r\\nmysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police', '\\r\\nfrom time to time i heard some vague account of his doings: of his\\r\\nsummons to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder, of his clearing up\\r\\nof the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee, and\\r\\nfinally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\\r\\nsuccessfully for the reigning family of holland', ' beyond these signs of\\r\\nhis activity, however, which i merely shared with all the readers of\\r\\nthe daily press, i knew little of my former friend and companion', '\\r\\n\\r\\none night—it was on the twentieth of march, 1888—i was returning from a\\r\\njourney to a patient (for i had now returned to civil practice), when\\r\\nmy way led me through baker street', ' as i passed the well-remembered\\r\\ndoor, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\\r\\nwith the dark incidents of the study in scarlet, i was seized with a\\r\\nkeen desire to see holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\\r\\nextraordinary powers', ' his rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as i\\r\\nlooked up, i saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\\r\\nagainst the blind', ' he was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\\r\\nhead sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him', ' to me, who\\r\\nknew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\\r\\nstory', ' he was at work again', ' he had risen out of his drug-created\\r\\ndreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem', ' i rang the bell\\r\\nand was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own', '\\r\\n\\r\\nhis manner was not effusive', ' it seldom was; but he was glad, i think,\\r\\nto see me', ' with hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\\r\\nme to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\\r\\nspirit case and a gasogene in the corner', ' then he stood before the fire\\r\\nand looked me over in his singular introspective fashion', '\\r\\n\\r\\n“wedlock suits you,” he remarked', ' “i think, watson, that you have put\\r\\non seven and a half pounds since i saw you', '”\\r\\n\\r\\n“seven!” i answered', '\\r\\n\\r\\n“indeed, i should have thought a little more', ' just a trifle more, i\\r\\nfancy, watson', ' and in practice again, i observe', ' you did not tell me\\r\\nthat you intended to go into harness', '”\\r\\n\\r\\n“then, how do you know?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i see it, i deduce it', ' how do i know that you have been getting\\r\\nyourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\\r\\nservant girl?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“my dear holmes,” said i, “this is too much', ' you would certainly have\\r\\nbeen burned, had you lived a few centuries ago', ' it is true that i had a\\r\\ncountry walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as i\\r\\nhave changed my clothes i can’t imagine how you deduce it', ' as to mary\\r\\njane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,\\r\\nagain, i fail to see how you work it out', '”\\r\\n\\r\\nhe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together', '\\r\\n\\r\\n“it is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside\\r\\nof your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is\\r\\nscored by six almost parallel cuts', ' obviously they have been caused by\\r\\nsomeone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in\\r\\norder to remove crusted mud from it', ' hence, you see, my double\\r\\ndeduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\\r\\nparticularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the london slavey', ' as\\r\\nto your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of\\r\\niodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right\\r\\nforefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where\\r\\nhe has secreted his stethoscope, i must be dull, indeed, if i do not\\r\\npronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession', '”\\r\\n\\r\\ni could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\\r\\nprocess of deduction', ' “when i hear you give your reasons,” i remarked,\\r\\n“the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i\\r\\ncould easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\\r\\nreasoning i am baffled until you explain your process', ' and yet i\\r\\nbelieve that my eyes are as good as yours', '”\\r\\n\\r\\n“quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\\r\\ndown into an armchair', ' “you see, but you do not observe', ' the\\r\\ndistinction is clear', ' for example, you have frequently seen the steps\\r\\nwhich lead up from the hall to this room', '”\\r\\n\\r\\n“frequently', '”\\r\\n\\r\\n“how often?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“well, some hundreds of times', '”\\r\\n\\r\\n“then how many are there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“how many? i don’t know', '”\\r\\n\\r\\n“quite so! you have not observed', ' and yet you have seen', ' that is just\\r\\nmy point', ' now, i know that there are seventeen steps, because i have\\r\\nboth seen and observed', ' by the way, since you are interested in these\\r\\nlittle problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\\r\\nof my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this', '” he threw\\r\\nover a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open\\r\\nupon the table', ' “it came by the last post,” said he', ' “read it aloud', '”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe note was undated, and without either signature or address', '\\r\\n\\r\\n“there will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it\\r\\nsaid, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very\\r\\ndeepest moment', ' your recent services to one of the royal houses of\\r\\neurope have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\\r\\nmatters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated', '\\r\\nthis account of you we have from all quarters received', ' be in your\\r\\nchamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\\r\\nwear a mask', '”\\r\\n\\r\\n“this is indeed a mystery,” i remarked', ' “what do you imagine that it\\r\\nmeans?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i have no data yet', ' it is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\\r\\ndata', ' insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\\r\\ntheories to suit facts', ' but the note itself', ' what do you deduce from\\r\\nit?”\\r\\n\\r\\ni carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\\r\\nwritten', '\\r\\n\\r\\n“the man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” i remarked,\\r\\nendeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes', ' “such paper could not\\r\\nbe bought under half a crown a packet', ' it is peculiarly strong and\\r\\nstiff', '”\\r\\n\\r\\n“peculiar—that is the very word,” said holmes', ' “it is not an english\\r\\npaper at all', ' hold it up to the light']\n"

By the roadside were many crosses  ,  ', 'and as we swept by  ,   my companions all crossed themselves  .   Here and there', 'was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine  ,   who did not even', 'turn round as we approached  ,   but seemed in the self  -  surrender of', 'devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world  .   There were', 'many things new to me  :   for instance  ,   hay  -  ricks in the trees  ,   and here', 'and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch  ,   their white stems', 'shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves  .

Sometimes  ,   as the road was cut through the pine woods', 'that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us  ,   great masses of', 'greyness  ,   which here and there bestrewed the trees  ,   produced a', 'peculiarly weird and solemn effect  ,   which carried on the thoughts and', 'grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening  ,   when the falling sunset', 'threw into strange relief the ghost  -  like clouds which amongst the', 'Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys  .

Then through the darkness I could see a sort of', 'patch of grey light ahead of us  ,   as though there were a cleft in the', 'hills  .   The excitement of the passengers grew greater  ;   the crazy coach', 'rocked on its great leather springs  ,   and swayed like a boat tossed on a', 'stormy sea  .   I had to hold on  .   The road grew more level  ,   and we appeared', 'to fly along  .

', 'Then  ,   as we flew along  ,   the driver leaned forward  ,   and on each side the', 'passengers  ,   craning over the edge of the coach  ,   peered eagerly into the', 'darkness  .   It was evident that something very exciting was either', 'happening or expected  ,   but though I asked each passenger  ,   no one would', 'give me the slightest explanation  .   This state of excitement kept on for', 'some little time  ;   and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on', 'the eastern side  .   There were dark  ,   rolling clouds overhead  ,   and in the', 'air the heavy  ,   oppressive sense of thunder  .   It seemed as though the', 'mountain range had separated two atmospheres  ,   and that now we had got', 'into the thunderous one  .   I was now myself looking out for the conveyance', 'which was to take me to the Count  .   Each moment I expected to see the', 'glare of lamps through the blackness  ;   but all was dark  .   The only light', 'was the flickering rays of our own lamps  ,   in which the steam from our', 'hard  -  driven horses rose in a white cloud  .   We could see now the sandy', 'road lying white before us  ,   but there was on it no sign of a vehicle  .  ', 'The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness  ,   which seemed to mock', 'my own disappointment  .   I was already thinking what I had best do  ,   when', 'the driver  ,   looking at his watch  ,   said to the others something which I', 'could hardly hear  ,   it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone  ;   I', 'thought it was   “  An hour less than the time  .    ”   Then turning to me  ,   he said', 'in German worse than my own  :    -    -  ', '  “  There is no carriage here  .   The Herr is not expected after all  .   He will', 'now come on to Bukovina  ,   and return to  -  morrow or the next day  ;   better', 'the next day  .    ”   Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and', 'snort and plunge wildly  ,   so that the driver had to hold them up  .   Then  ,  ', 'amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing', 'of themselves  ,   a calèche  ,   with four horses  ,   drove up behind us  ,   overtook', 'us  ,   and drew up beside the coach  .   I could see from the flash of our', 'lamps  ,   as the rays fell on them  ,   that the horses were coal  -  black and', 'splendid animals  .   They were driven by a tall man  ,   with a long brown', 'beard and a great black hat  ,   which seemed to hide his face from us  .   I', 'could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes  ,   which seemed red', 'in the lamplight  ,   as he turned to us  .   He said to the driver  :    -    -  ', '  “  You are early to  -  night  ,   my friend  .    ”   The man stammered in reply  :    -    -  ', '  “  The English Herr was in a hurry  ,    ”   to which the stranger replied  :    -    -  ', '  “  That is why  ,   I suppose  ,   you wished him to go on to Bukovina  .   You cannot', 'deceive me  ,   my friend  ;   I know too much  ,   and my horses are swift  .    ”   As he', 'spoke he smiled  ,   and the lamplight fell on a hard  -  looking mouth  ,   with', 'very red lips and sharp  -  looking teeth  ,   as white as ivory  .   One of my', 'companions whispered to another the line from Burger  ’  s   “  Lenore  ”    :    -    -  ', '      “  Denn die Todten reiten schnell  ”    -    -  ', '    (  “  For the dead travel fast  .    ”  )', 'The strange driver evidently heard the words  ,   for he looked up with a', 'gleaming smile  .   The passenger turned his face away  ,   at the same time', 'putting out his two fingers and crossing himself  .     “  Give me the Herr  ’  s', 'luggage  ,    ”   said the driver  ;   and with exceeding alacrity my bags were', 'handed out and put in the calèche  .   Then I descended from the side of the', 'coach  ,   as the calèche was close alongside  ,   the driver helping me with a', 'hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel  ;   his strength must have been', 'prodigious  .   Without a word he shook his reins  ,   the horses turned  ,   and we', 'swept into the darkness of the Pass  .   As I looked back I saw the steam', 'from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps  ,   and projected', 'against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves  .   Then', 'the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses  ,   and off they swept', 'on their way to Bukovina  .   As they sank into the darkness I felt a', 'strange chill  ,   and a lonely feeling came over me  ;   but a cloak was thrown', 'over my shoulders  ,   and a rug across my knees  ,   and the driver said in', 'excellent German  :    -    -  ', '  “  The night is chill  ,   mein Herr  ,   and my master the Count bade me take all', 'care of you  .

It', 'seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground', 'again  ;   and so I took note of some salient point  ,   and found that this was', 'so  .   I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant  ,   but', 'I really feared to do so  ,   for I thought that  ,   placed as I was  ,   any', 'protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to', 'delay  .   By  -  and  -  by  ,   however  ,   as I was curious to know how time was', 'passing  ,   I struck a match  ,   and by its flame looked at my watch  ;   it was', 'within a few minutes of midnight  .   This gave me a sort of shock  ,   for I', 'suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my', 'recent experiences  .   I waited with a sick feeling of suspense  .  ', 'Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road  -    -  a', 'long  ,   agonised wailing  ,   as if from fear  .   The sound was taken up by', 'another dog  ,   and then another and another  ,   till  ,   borne on the wind which', 'now sighed softly through the Pass  ,   a wild howling began  ,   which seemed', 'to come from all over the country  ,   as far as the imagination could grasp', 'it through the gloom of the night  .   At the first howl the horses began to', 'strain and rear  ,   but the driver spoke to them soothingly  ,   and they', 'quieted down  ,   but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from', 'sudden fright  .   Then  ,   far off in the distance  ,   from the mountains on each', 'side of us began a louder and a sharper howling  -    -  that of wolves  -    -  which', 'affected both the horses and myself in the same way  -    -  for I was minded to', 'jump from the calèche and run  ,   whilst they reared again and plunged', 'madly  ,   so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them', 'from bolting  .   In a few minutes  ,   however  ,   my own ears got accustomed to', 'the sound  ,   and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able', 'to descend and to stand before them  .   He petted and soothed them  ,   and', 'whispered something in their ears  ,   as I have heard of horse  -  tamers', 'doing  ,   and with extraordinary effect  ,   for under his caresses they became', 'quite manageable again  ,   though they still trembled  .   The driver again', 'took his seat  ,   and shaking his reins  ,   started off at a great pace  .   This', 'time  ,   after going to the far side of the Pass  ,   he suddenly turned down a', 'narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right  .  ', 'Soon we were hemmed in with trees  ,   which in places arched right over the', 'roadway till we passed as through a tunnel  ;   and again great frowning', 'rocks guarded us boldly on either side  .   Though we were in shelter  ,   we', 'could hear the rising wind  ,   for it moaned and whistled through the', 'rocks  ,   and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along  .  ', 'It grew colder and colder still  ,   and fine  ,   powdery snow began to fall  ,  ', 'so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket  .   The', 'keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs  ,   though this grew', 'fainter as we went on our way  .   The baying of the wolves sounded nearer', 'and nearer  ,   as though they were closing round on us from every side  .   I', 'grew dreadfully afraid  ,   and the horses shared my fear  .   The driver  ,  ', 'however  ,   was not in the least disturbed  ;   he kept turning his head to', 'left and right  ,   but I could not see anything through the darkness  .  ', 'Suddenly  ,   away on our left  ,   I saw a faint flickering blue flame  .   The', 'driver saw it at the same moment  ;   he at once checked the horses  ,   and  ,  ', 'jumping to the ground  ,   disappeared into the darkness  .   I did not know', 'what to do  ,   the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer  ;   but while', 'I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again  ,   and without a word took', 'his seat  ,   and we resumed our journey  .   I think I must have fallen asleep', 'and kept dreaming of the incident  ,   for it seemed to be repeated', 'endlessly  ,   and now looking back  ,   it is like a sort of awful nightmare  .  ', 'Once the flame appeared so near the road  ,   that even in the darkness', 'around us I could watch the driver  ’  s motions  .   He went rapidly to where', 'the blue flame arose  -    -  it must have been very faint  ,   for it did not seem', 'to illumine the place around it at all  -    -  and gathering a few stones  ,  ', 'formed them into some device  .   Once there appeared a strange optical', 'effect  :   when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it  ,  ', 'for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same  .   This startled me  ,   but', 'as the effect was only momentary  ,   I took it that my eyes deceived me', 'straining through the darkness  .   Then for a time there were no blue', 'flames  ,   and we sped onwards through the gloom  ,   with the howling of the', 'wolves around us  ,   as though they were following in a moving circle  .  ', 'At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he', 'had yet gone  ,   and during his absence  ,   the horses began to tremble worse', 'than ever and to snort and scream with fright  .   I could not see any cause', 'for it  ,   for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether  ;   but just', 'then the moon  ,   sailing through the black clouds  ,   appeared behind the', 'jagged crest of a beetling  ,   pine  -  clad rock  ,   and by its light I saw', 'around us a ring of wolves  ,   with white teeth and lolling red tongues  ,  ', 'with long  ,   sinewy limbs and shaggy hair  .   They were a hundred times more', 'terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled  .  ', 'For myself  ,   I felt a sort of paralysis of fear  .   It is only when a man', 'feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand', 'their true import  .  ', 'All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had', 'some peculiar effect on them  .   The horses jumped about and reared  ,   and', 'looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see  ;  ', 'but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side  ;   and they', 'had perforce to remain within it  .   I called to the coachman to come  ,   for', 'it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the', 'ring and to aid his approach  .   I shouted and beat the side of the', 'calèche  ,   hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side  ,   so as', 'to give him a chance of reaching the trap  .   How he came there  ,   I know', 'not  ,   but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command  ,   and', 'looking towards the sound  ,   saw him stand in the roadway  .   As he swept his', 'long arms  ,   as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle  ,   the wolves', 'fell back and back further still  .   Just then a heavy cloud passed across', 'the face of the moon  ,   so that we were again in darkness  .  ', 'When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche  ,   and the', 'wolves had disappeared  .   This was all so strange and uncanny that a', 'dreadful fear came upon me  ,   and I was afraid to speak or move  .   The time', 'seemed interminable as we swept on our way  ,   now in almost complete', 'darkness  ,   for the rolling clouds obscured the moon  .   We kept on', 'ascending  ,   with occasional periods of quick descent  ,   but in the main', 'always ascending  .   Suddenly  ,   I became conscious of the fact that the', 'driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a', 'vast ruined castle  ,   from whose tall black windows came no ray of light  ,  ', 'and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit', 'sky  .  ', 'CHAPTER II', 'JONATHAN HARKER  ’  S JOURNAL  -    -  _continued_', '_5 May  .  _  -    -  I must have been asleep  ,   for certainly if I had been fully', 'awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place  .   In', 'the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size  ,   and as several dark', 'ways led from it under great round arches  ,   it perhaps seemed bigger than', 'it really is  .   I have not yet been able to see it by daylight  .  ', 'When the calèche stopped  ,   the driver jumped down and held out his hand', 'to assist me to alight  .   Again I could not but notice his prodigious', 'strength  .   His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have', 'crushed mine if he had chosen  .   Then he took out my traps  ,   and placed', 'them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door  ,   old and', 'studded with large iron nails  ,   and set in a projecting doorway of', 'massive stone  .   I could see even in the dim light that the stone was', 'massively carved  ,   but that the carving had been much worn by time and', 'weather  .   As I stood  ,   the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the', 'reins  ;   the horses started forward  ,   and trap and all disappeared down one', 'of the dark openings  .  ', 'I stood in silence where I was  ,   for I did not know what to do  .   Of bell', 'or knocker there was no sign  ;   through these frowning walls and dark', 'window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate  .   The', 'time I waited seemed endless  ,   and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon', 'me  .   What sort of place had I come to  ,   and among what kind of people  ?  ', 'What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked  ?   Was this a', 'customary incident in the life of a solicitor  ’  s clerk sent out to', 'explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner  ?   Solicitor  ’  s', 'clerk  !   Mina would not like that  .   Solicitor  -    -  for just before leaving', 'London I got word that my examination was successful  ;   and I am now a', 'full  -  blown solicitor  !   I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if', 'I were awake  .   It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me  ,   and I', 'expected that I should suddenly awake  ,   and find myself at home  ,   with', 'the dawn struggling in through the windows  ,   as I had now and again felt', 'in the morning after a day of overwork  .   But my flesh answered the', 'pinching test  ,   and my eyes were not to be deceived  .   I was indeed awake', 'and among the Carpathians  .   All I could do now was to be patient  ,   and to', 'wait the coming of the morning  .  ', 'Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching', 'behind the great door  ,   and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming', 'light  .   Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of', 'massive bolts drawn back  .   A key was turned with the loud grating noise', 'of long disuse  ,   and the great door swung back  .  ', 'Within  ,   stood a tall old man  ,   clean shaven save for a long white', 'moustache  ,   and clad in black from head to foot  ,   without a single speck', 'of colour about him anywhere  .   He held in his hand an antique silver', 'lamp  ,   in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind  ,  ', 'throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the', 'open door  .   The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly', 'gesture  ,   saying in excellent English  ,   but with a strange intonation  :    -    -  ', '  “  Welcome to my house  !   Enter freely and of your own will  !    ”   He made no', 'motion of stepping to meet me  ,   but stood like a statue  ,   as though his', 'gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone  .   The instant  ,   however  ,   that', 'I had stepped over the threshold  ,   he moved impulsively forward  ,   and', 'holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince  ,  ', 'an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as', 'ice  -    -  more like the hand of a dead than a living man  .   Again he said  :    -    -  ', '  “  Welcome to my house  .   Come freely  .   Go safely  ;   and leave something of the', 'happiness you bring  !    ”   The strength of the handshake was so much akin to', 'that which I had noticed in the driver  ,   whose face I had not seen  ,   that', 'for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was', 'speaking  ;   so to make sure  ,   I said interrogatively  :    -    -  ', '  “  Count Dracula  ?    ”   He bowed in a courtly way as he replied  :    -    -  ', '  “  I am Dracula  ;   and I bid you welcome  ,   Mr  .

At the end of this he threw open a heavy door  ,   and I rejoiced', 'to see within a well  -  lit room in which a table was spread for supper  ,  ', 'and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs  ,   freshly replenished  ,  ', 'flamed and flared  .
